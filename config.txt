# This is the config file for the SimpleFileCleaner.py script
# If you want to specify an hour where the clean must be executed, # please use H:XX:XX at the start of the file# You can add files or directories to delete in this file
# To add a file or directory, just write the path to the file or directory
# To add a file or directory with a regex, write the regex after the path, separated by a ':'
# You specify the type of deletion with the first letter of the line then ":" then the regex
# The types are :
# P : Set the path to the directory to clean
# D : Delete all directories with the regex in the path
# DR : Delete all directories with the regex in the path and in all subdirectories
# F : Delete all files with the regex in the path
# FR : Delete all files with the regex in the path and in all subdirectories
# A : Delete all files and directories with the regex in the path and in all subdirectories
# E : Delete all empty directories with the regex in the path
# ER : Delete all empty directories with the regex in the path and in all subdirectories
# Example :
# H:03:05
# P:C:/Users/username/Desktop
# D:myDirectory_*
# P:C:/Users/username/Documents
# F:myFile_*
# ER:*
# 
# Every day, at 3h05:# This will delete all directories starting with "myDirectory_" in the Desktop directory
# Then it will delete all files starting with "myFile_" in the Documents directory
# Then it will delete all empty directories in the Documents directory and in all subdirectories
# And if you don't understand, # Signify that the whole line is a commentary
